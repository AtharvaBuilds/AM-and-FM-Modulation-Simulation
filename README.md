This project presents a simulation and visualization of Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Frequency Modulation (FM) using Python programming. Modulation is a key aspect of communication systems, where message signals are superimposed on high-frequency carrier signals for efficient transmission. The main focus of this project is to demonstrate the behaviour and impact of varying the modulation index on both AM and FM signals through a real-time interactive interface. Python libraries such as Tkinter and Matplotlib are utilized for GUI creation and plotting. The developed simulation offers an effective learning tool for students and learners to grasp fundamental concepts of modulation intuitively and visually.
